# MicroSTS - a token issuer service with IdentityServer and an Angular admin UI

This project aims for a fully working and minimalistic [Security Token Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token_service) with local user administration.

It takes advantage of the following existing functionality:
- **[IdentityServer](https://identityserver.io/)**: handles all the OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 protocol stuff
- **[ASP.NET Core Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio)**: handles the general public available login functionality and manages users, passwords, profile data, roles, claims, tokens, email confirmation, and more
- **[Angular](https://angular.io/)**: provides a minimalistic ui for administrate resources, clients, claimtypes and users.
